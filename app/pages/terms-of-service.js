        <p className="text-zinc-400 text-sm mb-6">
          Any types of Investments in financial markets, foreign exchange (FX)
          cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, and financial securities are

          SECTION 9 - EARNINGS DISCLAIMER AND FORWARD DISCLAIMER
        </p>
        <p className="text-zinc-400 text-sm mb-6">
          There is no assurance or guarantee in financial markets therefore
          there is no guarantee that goals for any profits you might have
          planned will be achieved. As with any money market, your investment in
          your financial market of choosing also depends on various factors,
          variables, currency, economic, political, business risks and
          situations and therefore should be considered highly risky and
          volatile. We do not make any promises that your investments will be
          profitable and therefore, Pryzma will not be responsible or liable for
          any loss or shortfall resulting from the operation of any
          investment-related to Pryzma’s research materials or software. Our
          research materials and services may contain “forward-looking
          statements”. Any statements that express or involve discussions
          concerning predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections,
          objectives, goals, assumptions, or future events or performance are
          not statements of historical fact and may be “forward-looking
          statements.” Forward-looking statements are based on expectations,
          estimates, and projections at the time the statements are made that
          involve several risks and uncertainties which could cause actual
          results or events to differ materially from those presently
          anticipated. Forward-looking statements in this action may be
          identified through the use of words such as “expects”, “will,”
          “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” or statements indicating
          certain actions “may,” “could,” or “might” occur.
